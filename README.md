## During the project
- always pull before work, to be updated with the last version <br>
- start a new branch to make your changes <br>
- always use git status <br>
- after testing what you change and it is working properly, do git add (only add the files you want to commit and push) <br>
- after adding, you commit with those changes with a standard naming of titles <br>
- git commit -m “ brief description of this commit” <br>
- push, prefer with the full syntax to avoid any undesired pushes <br>
- push &lt;to&gt; &lt;local branch name&gt;:&lt;remote branch name to push in it&gt; <br>
